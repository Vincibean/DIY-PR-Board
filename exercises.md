![elevated push-up](./img/elevated-push-up.gif)

**Muscles Involved:** Lower Pectorals, Triceps

Position yourself in front of a box or chair. Rest your hands on the box or chair, with your feet about four feet away. Your body should form a 45-degree angle when your arms are extended. Lower yourself toward the box. Exhale as you push straight up. Keep your elbows and arms over the box / chair at all times. Maintain a neutral spine position throughout.

## REGULAR PUSH-UP
![push-up](./img/push-up.gif)

**Muscles involved:** Pectoral, Triceps

Lie face down on the floor with your hands shoulder width apart. Lift up to a fully extended arm position. Your body should form a straight line without sagging at the hips. Lower yourself down to the floor, moving in a perfectly plane position. Go down until your nose touches the floor. Keeping your core tight and your body perfectly flat, push back to the start position.

## SPIDER-MAM PUSH-UP
![spider-man press-up](./img/spider-man-press-up.jpg)

Start in the top of a press-up position. Bend your arms to lower your chest until it’s just off the floor and simultaneously bring one knee up to your elbow, then return to the start. Alternate knees. On the final single rep, make this super-slow – do it over a ten count.

## WIDE-GRIP PUSH-UP
![wide-grip press-up](./img/wide-grip-press-up.jpg)

**Muscles Involved:** Pectorals, Triceps

Start in a press-up position with hands elevated. Lower towards the bench, then explode up until you’re almost standing. Clap your hands, put them back out to break your fall and go into the next rep.

## DIAMOND PUSH-UP
![diamond push-up](./img/diamond-push-up.gif)

By placing your hands together and keeping your elbows close to your body to do a diamond push-up, the emphasis is placed upon your triceps as opposed to your chest.
Start in a push-up position with your thumbs and index fingers of each hand touching to make a diamond shape. While keeping your elbows as close to your side as possible, lower yourself down until your chest touches the back of your hands. Keep everything tight (abs, glutes, thigh muscles) throughout the movement. Push back up to the starting position and repeat.

## REVERSE PUSH-UPS

**Muscles Involved:** Brachialis, Grip Strength

Assume a standard push-up position, but have your hands very wide, twice shoulder width apart. Turn your fingers so that they are pointing towards your feet.
Now perform your push-ups, going as low as you can and feeling the isolation in the biceps.
