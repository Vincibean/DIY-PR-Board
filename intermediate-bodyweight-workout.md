# The Intermediate Bodyweight Workout
## 3 Circuits
* 10 Bodyweight Squats
* 10 Walking Lunges
* 15 Jump Ups
* 3 Assisted Pull-Ups (or 6 inverted bodyweight rows)
* 8 Dips (or 10 decline push-ups if these are too tough)
* 3 Assisted Chin-Ups (or 6 inverted bodyweight rows)
* 10 Push-Ups
* 30 Second Plank
* 30 Jumping Jacks


In a circuit routine, you’ll do each exercise in succession without a break in between, if you’re able.

Once you’ve finished all exercises in the circuit, do it again.

If you’re still able after the 2nd run through, go for a third.

Because all of these exercises come one after another, you’re bound to get tired – and that’s okay!

It’s better to stop and take a break than to do an exercise incorrectly.

The goal is to give you a full-body workout that leaves you panting.

Go at your own pace, but the above 3 circuits and your warm-up and cool down will take you about 25-30 minutes.
