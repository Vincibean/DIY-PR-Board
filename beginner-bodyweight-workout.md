**This is the Beginner Bodyweight Workout (3 Circuits):**

*   20 Bodyweight squats.
*   10 Push-ups.
*   10 Walking lunges (each leg).
*   10 Dumbbell rows (use a milk jug or other weight).
*   15 Second Plank.
*   30 Jumping jacks.

In a [circuit routine](https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/circuit-training-build-some-muscles-burn-some-fat/), you’ll do each exercise in succession without a break in between (if you’re able).

*   Once you’ve finished all exercises in the circuit, do it again.
*   If you’re still able after the 2nd run through, go for a third.

Because all of these exercises come one after another, you’re bound to get tired – and that’s okay!

It’s better to stop and take a break than to do an exercise incorrectly.
